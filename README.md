About the project:

An interactive simulation that allows the user to control a submarine and explore an underwater world.
Made as the final folder assignment for the Game Engine Architecture course at HÃ¸gskolen i Innlandet.
The scene of the project: MainScene can be found in assets/scenes.

The project includes:

  Procedural terrain generation using the marching cubes algorithm and 3D noise. 
  (Using compute shaders/hlsl).
  
  Simulated flocking behavior (boids). 
  
  A simple terrain chunk loading system. 

Submarine Movement Controls:

    W - forward
    S - backward
    A - turn left
    D - turn right
    Left Ctrl - Descend
    Space/Shift - Ascend
